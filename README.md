The essence of the game is as follows: one player guesses the city and shows the other player some part of the map (or photograph) of this city. The second player must guess the city. Then they switch initiative. Of course, the displayed area does not show the name of the city.

The database contains a list of cities.

Using the function of selecting point-dimensions of the city, a request is formed and you get a satellite image or a map of a part of the city.

What to show - a satellite or a map - is shown randomly.
